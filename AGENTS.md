# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## External Dependencies

- The project relies on `tailwindcss` and `qrcode` loaded from a CDN in `index.html`. These are not managed through `package.json`.

## Code Style

- A path alias `@/*` is configured in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` to point to the project root.

## Video Background

- The background video is a YouTube embed. The video ID can be changed in `index.html`.
